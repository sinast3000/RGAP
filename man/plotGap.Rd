  tsl,
  legend,

  contribution,
  res = NULL,
  namesPrint,
  bounds,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{tsl}{A list with two multiple time series objects for the first and second plot,
respectively.}

\item{legend}{A list with two character vectors. The first contains the legend names for
the first plot and so on.}

\item{title}{A list with the titles for the first three plots.}

\item{boundName}{The legend name of the confidence bounds.}

\item{contribution}{A boolean indicating whether the contributions to potential output
growth and the output gap should be plotted (only applicable for production function
type output gaps.)}

\item{res}{The residual series as time series. If \code{res = NULL}, all graphs related
to the residual series will not be plotted.}

\item{namesPrint}{A character vector containing two names for the first two plots. The
remaining names are creates automatically if \code{combine = FALSE}.}

\item{bounds}{A logical indicating whether significance intervals should be plotted around
the nawru. The default is \code{bounds = TRUE}.}

\item{combine}{A logical indicating whether the diagnostic plots should be combined or not,
the default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{path}{An optional file path. If specified, the plots will be saved using the format
in \code{device} under the given path.}

\item{device}{Device passed on to \code{ggplot} for plot saving. Options are eps", "ps",
"tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf".}

\item{width}{The plot width in case of printing.}

\item{height}{The plot height in case of printing.}
